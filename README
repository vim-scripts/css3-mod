This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4089

The script is based on "css3" and the official css syntax file

original "css3" : http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3042

Added more CSS3 properties,attr,tagname etc...  Fix some problems of the original script. And prefix like -moz-, -webkit-  to the part of the script, and more
